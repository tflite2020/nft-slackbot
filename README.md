While on slack, users can batch mint NFTs directly from contract by putting in parameters. The slack channels allows you to keep track of your positions. Furthermore, users will be able to list these NFTs on OpenSeas and x2y2 through the script.  

The purpose of this is so that you can conviniently mint even on the go!
